        <P><font size="+2">
    The main idea of my project would be <MARK><STRONG>Automation</MARK></STRONG>. In companies, automation rationalises all the areas by automatically 
    attaining tasks that an employee would otherwise had to do manually. In this project, I’m going to explicate 
    automation in a company which would be useful for joining of new employees till the time they commence their job. 
    This will help in pre-screening of an employee and making sure that all the requirements and expectations of the 
    company are met by them.And once the hiring process is done, it will make sure that the employee has an ID to 
    access the portal.
    </P>

        <P><font size="+2">
    This project would help companies and businesses by making their hiring process fairly simple. In order to ease
     it for the staff, this automated software is going to pre-screen the employee’s CV and check for the educational 
     and experience requirements. Once the hiring is done, it generates an ID and details for the new employees and 
     remove the ones for the staff that has been resigned. This way, the dependence on staff would eradicate. This will 
     also be cost effective to the company.<BR><BR>
 
    Much more than just replacing paper and PDFs with dynamic digital data, business automation factors in the key 
 steps in a company’s workflows and then attempts to make these processes cheaper, faster and less error-prone. <BR><BR>

    Hence the main idea of this project is <U>“Minimum Labour Maximum Output.”</U></font>

    <font size="+3" color="Green">

        <H2><I><U>DESCRIPTION:</H2></I></U></font>
    <P>
        For the project, it is a user friendly interface wherein companies and businesses can make use of.
         Often happens in giant companies where hundreds of employees are hired and many are terminated every day, 
         it is the staff that is burdened to process their applications, create ID and details for the employees. 
</P>

<p>

This automated software will go through all the applications submitted online. It was check whether the expectations
 and requirements of the job position are met by a pre fed data according to the job. This may include educational 
 background, qualifications, work experience, additional certifications, etc. mentioned on their resume. If the 
 application is successful, it will be passed further to the seniors for interviews. If the application is unsuccessful, 
 it will automatically be added to the waitlist to be viewed by the team later.

</p>

<p>
It will also automatically create an ID and relevant details for the new joiners and remove the details for the ones 
who have resigned. For creating an ID, it would take first letter of the first name of the employee and the last name 
of the employee followed by a unique number. Same way, a work email ID and temporary password would also be created. 
This would ensure that there are minimal or no duplicates of the same ID.
</p>

<p>
Since, it is going to be done with the help of a system, it would ensure that there are no mistakes and workflow is 
optimised. Also, this would eradicate the dependency on human resource and hence these employees would be able to devote 
their precious time on other departments. This method is cost effective as well as a great time saver as well. It creates 
user account with role based access and providing the right access as per the role from day one with user provisioning 
templates. It ensures proper access, keeps a check on errors and speeds process. Even if an employee joins on a national 
holiday, his ID and details would be generated by the system; hence no delays at all. By integrating these processes onto 
technology platforms, companies also benefit from better reporting capabilities and the ability to analyse data over time.
That information then informs key decisions and helps the business grow.
</p>

<p>
The ultimate goal, after all, is less to replace human labour and more to augment with technology in a way that helps 
improve the entire, end-to-end process. This software will definitely make the process of staffing and dismissing super 
smooth and seamless.

    According to me, this software is a major time saver in terms of staffing. Till now, companies had a hiring team 
    to go through applications then shortlist the eligible applicants according to the requirements. And then, when the 
    applicants get their job, there is an IT team to provide them with their portal IDs and VM and giving them access 
    accordingly. </p>
<p>But with automation, we don’t have to worry about selecting through many applications and shortlisting. 
Even, the IDs, passwords and access is also done by it. With this, the employees can work in other advancement of the 
business and the process of staffing is seemless
