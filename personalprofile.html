    <p>According to the results, the mind i.e., the trait that determines how one communicates with <br>
    the people and how well he/she is able to keep up with people and know them; is 74 per cent extraverted<br>
     for me which clearly implies that I get along with most people and tend to open up freely without <br>
     much hesitation and reticence.<br></p>
     <p>The energy i.e., the trait that elucidates where we administer our mental energy is 56 per cent intuitive for me <br>
        which implies that sometimes I rely on my instincts when I’m not too sure of a decision. I emphasis more on hidden <br>
        information and consider distant possibilities. Otherwise, I tend to be observant and keen-eyed.</p>
    <p>The Nature i.e., the trait that ascertains the way one makes decisions and manages with emotions which <br>
        is mostly (78 per cent) ‘feeling’ for me. I am a person who values sentiments and prioritise on empathy <br>
        and harmony.</p>
    <p>The Judging i.e., the trait that reflects one’s tactic of forethought, work and analysing; is 76 per cent <br>
        based on judgement for me. I am decisive and like things in an organized way. I will rarely prospect and <br>
        always value the lucidity and making wise decisions.</p>
    <p>The Identity i.e., the trait that reinforces all others and reveals how self-assured one us in their abilities<br>
     and decisions is more than half of the times (60 percent) turbulent for me. I am sometimes assertive but mostly <br>
     I try to do things with perfection and am quite eager to improve.</p>

<p><mark>Visual learners</mark> learn best when information is presented in a <mark>written language</mark> format<br>
     or in another visual format such as <mark>pictures or diagrams</mark>. If you are a visual learner, the <br>
     characteristics that follow can help you to succeed in your educational institution to the best of your ability.<br>
     <br>
    •	Create graphic organizers such as diagrams and concept maps that use visual symbols to represent <br>
    ideas and information.<br>
    •	When trying to remember information, close your eyes and visualize the information.<br>
    •	Include illustrations as you take notes in class.<br>
    •	Use highlighter pens of contrasting colours to colour code different aspects of the information <br>
    in your textbooks.<br>
    •	Sit in the front of the class so that you can see the teacher. This will allow you to pick up facial <br>
    expressions and body language that provide cues that what your teacher is saying is important to write <br>
    in your notes. Study in a place that is free from visual distractions.<br>
    •	When using flashcards, limit the amount of information on a card so that you can form a mental picture<br> 
    of the information.<br>
    •	Watch videos about topics you are studying in class.<br>
    •	When hearing a new word you want to remember, visualize its spelling.<br>
    •	When reviewing information, rewrite or draw the information from memory.<br>
    •	When taking notes, replace words with symbols wherever possible.<br>
    •	Type your written notes from the class using different fonts, bold print, and underlining to make the<br>
     most important concepts and facts visually apparent.<br>
    •	When solving math problems that involve a sequence of steps, draw a series of boxes, each containing the <br>
    appropriate piece of information in sequence.<br>

    <br>
        <u><strong>Openness to Experience – Low Characteristics</strong> </u></font></p>
    
    <font size="+2">
<p>I am low in openness to experience. People who are low in openness to <br>
    experience are typically very dedicated to any work they do, and always make <br>
    sure to see their tasks through to the end. I am not very artistic or <br>
    imaginative and do not see the value in unnecessary things like art and music.</p>

<p>I am very analytical and am able to think quickly to solve any problem I am faced with. <br>
   My first instinct is to use tried-and-true methods when solving problems.</p>

    <p>I tend to see things as black-and-white. I believe that people usually do not change, and <br>
    people are either good or bad. I believe that someone’s personality traits and choices play a <br>
    bigger role than luck or circumstance.</p>

    <p>People who are low in openness to experience often are well-suited for careers that allow them to <br>
    have daily routines, with very clear job duties. For example, I may be well-suited for a job in <br>
    finance, mechanics, or technology.</p>

    <p><font size="+2" color="blue">
        <br>
            <u><strong>Extraversion – Low Characteristics</strong> </u></font></p>
        <p>I am an introvert. While I enjoy spending time with others, I truly get my <br>
            energy by spending time by myself. Spending too much time around others leaves me feeling <br>
            tired and drained. Others describe me as thoughtful and quiet. Being the centre of attention <br>
            usually makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>I may not be a social butterfly, but I do an amazing job building relationships with others.<br>
             I find that I typically have a few friends whom I am very close with, rather than many <br>
             acquaintances. The relationships I have with others are usually very long-lasting.</p>
        
        <p>Others would describe me as very detail-oriented. I listen more than I speak, and am thoughtful<br>
        about whatever I say. In stressful situations, I always seem calm and level-headed.</p>

        <p>Introverts do best in jobs that allow them to spend most of the day alone. If put into a job that<br>
             requires too much time spent with others, introverts leave work feeling completely exhausted. The<br>
              best jobs for introverts include those involving art, technology, or science – such as a <br>
              photographer, lab worker, or computer programmer.</p>

              <p><font size="+2" color="blue">
                <br>
                    <u><strong>Neuroticism – Medium Characteristics</strong> </u></font></p>
        
        <p>I am moderately neurotic – at times, I can be anxious or emotional, while at other times, I am <br>
            relaxed and calm. My mood may fluctuate slightly, depending on the day.</p>
<p>I describe yourself as a realist. I don’t tend to be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic, and am able <br>
    to view problems clearly and realistically, considering many factors.</p>
<p>My neurotic traits – such as worrying about how you are perceived by others – make me successful in my <br>
    career. Coupled with my ability to remain level-headed, I have a great balance of traits to be a natural <br>
    leader. I try to do my best at everything, even if there doesn’t seem to be anything in it for me. People <br>
    who are moderate in neuroticism make great employees and supervisors.</p>
    <p>People who are moderately neurotic typically do well in helping careers, such as counselling or <br>
        public service</p>

    <HR>
    <BR>
        <P><I>
        I think these results are close to who I actually am. Scraping the characteristics from the tests which imply 
        that I like socialising, which is true as knowing new people’s cultures and backgrounds interests me a lot 
        coming from a multi-cultural country myself. Sometimes I may be emotional or anxious but mostly I’m optimistic 
        and poised even under pressure. I try to give my best shot at everything I do and am also eager to improve. 
        I may not be an extrovert but I try and build as many relationships as I can since I like interacting with new 
        people. 
        </P></I>

        <P><I>
        These results show that when I’m working in a team, I would like to know the people. I always want to work 
        together as a team. We will come out with backup plans too just in case anything hampers the business. We will 
        give our best shot in everything we do and will be open to feedbacks as well. I would go out of my way to help 
        my team and participate no matter what it takes. I would never procrastinate work since unproductive days are a 
        major discomfort for me. Hence, I’ll never leave any work for last moment, and I’ll make sure that it is done 
        in a systematic and disciplined manner.
        </I></P>

<P><I>
    When asked to make a team for myself, I would definitely look for a similar personality so that it is easier for 
    me to work with them. I would look for an equivalent hard working co-workers who understand the importance of time 
    and work and know how to prioritise their jobs. I would love to work with people who like to have conversations and 
    discussions rather than just minding their work.
</I></P>
