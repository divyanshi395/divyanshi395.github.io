<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>I’m Divyanshi Bhasin, a 17-year-old Indian who loves to read and explore new places.<br>
   My forte is swimming and I’ve won several laurels in that. I completed my high school at Sri Venkateshwar <br>
   International School, Dwarka, New Delhi, India, and secured High Distinction in grade 12. I can read and <br>
    speak English and Hindi fluently. 

</p>
<BR>
<H3>Intriguing facts about me: </H3>
 <P>Technology interests me a lot. I try and keep up with the updates as much as I can. <BR>
  I own a pet dog whose name is Shiro. He’s one year old and I miss him the most here. </P>


  <H2>Interest in IT:</H2>
<P>
    My interest in IT starts way back when I was in middle school. I was introduced to the computer language <BR>
    and programming for the first time then. It caught my interest from the start itself. Therefore, I got my <BR>
    first laptop when I was twelve. There was no coming back from there. I would study all the chapters before<BR>
    my tutor and would try to do the practice on my laptop. I became a tech enthusiast and hence topped the <BR>
    subject. Internet and networks would always trigger my curiosity and made me question how an invisible thing <br>
    can transfer data, perform bank transfers, and communicate with people who live poles apart. My uncle who has <br>
    worked for IBM, Microsoft, and KPMG and now working with MetLife would always help me clear my queries and <br>
    teach me something new about tech every day.<br>
    Nowadays, most of our day-to-day tasks and chores involve technology. Many tasks related to work and personal life have<br>
    been made easier and more productive with technology. The fact that we have wearable tech, storage for 100+ books in our kindle, <br>
    and our timetable for each day sorted in our mobile phones overwhelms me. When I taught my grandma to order groceries while <br>
    sitting in her living room and receiving them in no time made me realize that it is a great sense of satisfaction for an IT <br>
    consultant to persuade people to adopttechnology that simplifies things for them. <br>
    RMIT was my first preference university as it is one of the high ranked universities in Australia, especially in technology-based courses. <br>
    Combining theory and project experience, an IT qualification from RMIT gives you the skills to develop IT infrastructures and support the people <br>
    who use them - from network and data administration, programming, and client support, to specialized skills to lead innovation in IT. It is also <br>
    known for its innovative teaching model which develops programming skills in students through practical and project-based work. Programs here are <br>
    lively, interactive, and relevant to the international technology world. Superb facility and learning environments include world-class learning resources<br>
    and industry expert tutors. Student support here is one of the essential features including friendly staff to guide the students. It also includes the conduct <br>
    of a wide range of events and competitions to engage the students throughout and provide them with relevant exposure. <br>
    Furthermore, I loved the fact that it focuses on the future employability of students, with a range of industry-leading projects <br>
    preparing graduates for their future careers. I expect to learn major branches of IT in this course. I also think that it’ll sharpen <br>
    skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, analysis, communication, teamwork, etc.<br>
    Hence, I prefer learning the core subject than a part of it since it opens the doors to all opportunities in the course.
